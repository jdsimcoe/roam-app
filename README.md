# Roam Research App

> An iOS app for Roam Research, including a "Share to Roam" extension.

This app wraps the Roam Research website in a webview, allowing you to benefit from native app features such as multitasking on iPad. It also includes a Share Sheet integration which leverages Roam's Quick Capture page to quickly share any content to your graph from the native iOS share menu.

## Installing

I've submitted this app for inclusion on the App Store, but it probably won't be accepted (Apple doesn't really like apps which just "wrap" websites).

If you really want to run this on your device, your best bet is to grab the `.ipa` file from the [releases tab](https://github.com/m1guelpf/roam-app/releases) and install it with [Altstore](https://altstore.io/) (see [this guide](https://iosninja.io/altstore)). Or, if you're a developer and know what you're doing, use Xcode.

## Contributing

This is my first iOS app, and my first experience with Swift. There are probably much better ways to do the things I've done and, if you know them, I'd really appreciate a PR üòÅ

Other than that, a better onboarding mechanism (an actual Swift view to select your graph instead of an alert) would be very welcome.
